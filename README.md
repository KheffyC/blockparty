## Features 
Block Party is centered around the user. Easy accessibility to groups and ease of editing allows each user to feel in control of what they share online.

- **Accessibliity** - With a fluid, responsive navbar, you'll be able to move around the website with ease. Anywhere you want to go, you can go from the navbar
- **Django Auth** - Feel secure knowing that all url paths are protected and require users to log in before accessing any groups. With DjangoAuth Login, you have the ability to delete your account and all data along with it as well!
- **Protected Posts/Comments** - The most important feature about BlockParty? Only **YOU** can update, and remove any posts/comments that you create.

## General Assembly
This is project 3 of our Software Engineering Immersive Program at General Assembly.

The main focus of this project was to create a fully functional Python/Django full stack application. We had to navigate real world situations by working through problems as a team and discovering new solutions along the way.
